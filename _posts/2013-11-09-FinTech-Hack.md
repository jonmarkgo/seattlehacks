The goal of the FinTech Hackathon is to promote the development of financial technology for consumers and institutional customers. 

The Hackathon brings together FinTech developers and designers to develop financial products and discover new technologies. Example applications include innovations in risk management, trading, big data, retail banking, regulatory compliance, mobile payments and enterprise social.

APIs and platforms from technology partners will be made available during the Hackathon. Attendees will spend 24 hours coding, validating their ideas, networking and then demoing their hacks to a panel of VCs, executives and entrepreneurs.

Attendees can participate individually or in teams and teams can be formed prior to the Hackathon. Attendees are responsible for coming to the event with FinTech related ideas or finding a team to work with during the Hackathon. The Hackathon organizers and Technology partners may also provide teams potential ideas to work on and offer prizes to the best team. 

Our next event is in NYC on November 9-10th.
